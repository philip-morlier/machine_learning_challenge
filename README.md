# machine_learning_challenge

both of my models performed well. A little too well maybe. I suspect overfitting. 
I also left the koi_score in the data frame. Initially I did this to prove to my self that
the random forest would heavily weight its importance. When that didnt happen I decided to 
leave it for training and testing the neural network. If I had more time I would have 
chopped the data up more to get an idea as to which of the features may be giving such high
numbers.
